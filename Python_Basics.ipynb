What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","   --\n","   - Python is a programming language that is easy to read and write. It is popular because:\n","\n","     - It has a simple and beginner-friendly syntax.\n","\n","     - It can be used for many things like web development, data science, automation, AI, and more.\n","\n","    - It has a huge community and many ready-made libraries to make coding easier.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","   --\n","   - An interpreter is a program that reads and runs Python code line by line. This makes it easier to test and debug programs compared to languages that need compilation.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","   --\n","   - Keywords are special words in Python that have a fixed meaning. They are used for specific purposes like loops, conditions, and functions.\n","    - For example, if, else, for, while, def, return, etc.\n","  \n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","   --\n","   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved for special purposes. For example, you cannot name a variable if or else.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","   --\n","   - Mutability means whether a value can be changed after it is created.\n","\n","    - Mutable objects can be changed (like lists).\n","\n","    - Immutable objects cannot be changed (like tuples).\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","   --\n","   - Lists are designed to be flexible, so you can add, remove, or change elements. Tuples, on the other hand, are meant to be fixed, which makes them faster and safer for storing constant values.\n","\n","7. What is the ditterence between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in Python?\n","   --\n","   - '==' checks if values are the same.\n","\n","   - 'is' checks if two variables refer to the same memory location (same object).\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","   --\n","   - Logical operators help combine conditions:\n","\n","    - and -> True if both conditions are true\n","\n","    - or -> True if at least one condition is true\n","\n","    - not -> Reverses a condition\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","   --\n","   - Type casting means converting a value from one data type to another. For example, changing an integer to a string.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","   --\n","   - **Implicit**: Python automatically converts types (no need to do it manually).\n","   - **Explicit**: You manually convert types using functions like int(), float(), str().\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","   --\n","   - Conditional statements (if, elif, else) allow a program to make decisions based on conditions.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","    - elif which is short for \"else if\" is used when you have multiple conditions to check."],"metadata":{"id":"Pn6PT0TEXDZ2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# For Example\n","age =  22\n","if age < 12:\n","    print(\"Child\")\n","elif age < 18:\n","    print(\"Teenager\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"Adult\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nUFvhqAnbD1S","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743042451855,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"J K","userId":"05637729738182335588"}},"outputId":"7fa48537-efae-4173-a931-49d9de155605"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Adult\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13.
